# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Functional State Updates: `state()` setter now fully supports functional callback updates (`setCount(prev => prev + 1)`), enabling safe updates based on previous state values.
- React Ecosystem Compatibility: Seamlessly normalizes `className` to native `class` attributes at the HyperScript level, preserving full dynamic property descriptor/getter reactivity.
- CamelCase Event Normalization: Automatic mapping for CamelCase listeners (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`) into lower-case native browser event triggers.

### Fixed
- SPA Viewport Scroll Reset: Fixed a critical single-page routing bug where changing pages/views kept the previous page's scroll position. The viewport now automatically resets to the top `(0, 0)` upon every successful route transition in `Pages`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Comprehensive reactive `head()` engine supporting arrays of custom metadata (`meta`, `link`, `script`).
- Added strict `data-levelo-head="true"` DOM tracking attributes to dynamically injected layout headers.
- Native automated head tag parsing and state-purging to instantly eliminate redundant/duplicate meta elements during dynamic routing shifts.
- Full structural shorthand support for core document layout mappings (`themeColor`, `keywords`, `description`, `base`).

### Changed
- Refactored `head()` to seamlessly execute inline within functional components to unlock 100% reactive, state-driven title and SEO context updates.
